Two main aspects of litigation
1. Expensive
2. Time consuming

Negotiation;- Very Informal

Mediation:- More formal, mediator will meet both parties for short amount of time and then finally give advise.
ANd then both parties sign a document. If neither party does not settle, off the court you go.

Arbitration:- Usually parties sign closure contract. Either party select an expert, both parties explain 
their side of case to exper. and then, expert takes decision.
Thats the end of story, because arbitrator is a legal operator. 
The arbitrator makes judgement because he is a legal officer.
More informal but arbitrator's ruling is based on the law. Usually a senior lawyer.

Remember anytime before the judge makes the ruling, parties can settle anytime before the ruling is made.
